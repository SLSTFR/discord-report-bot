# discord-report-bot
A report bot for Unbeaten Roleplay Server
It needs a bot and channel tokens. One channel meant to be a button provider. Other one is for admins to track logs and delete some if they want.
When you tap "Rapor Olu≈ütur"(Create a Report), it automatically creates a channel like "username-report".
You can /kapat(close) the case or you can log it down by /kaydet(save). If you choose /kaydet it will give a case ID for each cases that user created.(special for each user)
When you do that it will write all messages to userReports.json file
And you can recall that messages from a particular user

You dont need to create userReports.json it will create on by own
